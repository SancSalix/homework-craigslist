    <p>I have a early 90's Schwinn High Plains Mountain Bike in excellent condition...very well made and maintained. 26" Tires and Size is Large. Very clean and rides great. Would be a great all round, all purpose bike that will last. Has Cro-Mo frame 21 speed Shimano 200 GS components and a newer saddle.</p>
    <p>This is not the department store type of bike now sold, but was made when Schwinn was putting out quality bikes with higher end components.</p>
    <p>Priced to sell quickly.<p>
